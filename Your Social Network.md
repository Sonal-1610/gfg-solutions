## 01. Your Social Network

### Problem Description

**Task:** Geek is creating a social networking site called Geeksbook with n users numbered from 1 to n. Each user i (2 ≤ i ≤ n) has exactly one friend, and that friend must have a smaller user number than i. User 1 has no friend. The friends of users 2 to n are given in an array arr[] of size n - 1, where:
arr[0] is the friend of user 2.
arr[1] is the friend of user 3.
...
arr[i - 2] is the friend of user i.
The relationship is one-way. A user can reach another user by repeatedly following their friend's link. For every user i from 2 to n, find all users j (1 ≤ j < i) that can be reached from i. For every reachable pair (i, j), create an array [i, j, k] where:
i is the starting user.
j is the reachable user.
k is the number of links that must be followed to reach j from i.
The result should contain these arrays in the following order:
Process users i from 2 to n.
For each user i, consider users j from 1 to i - 1 in increasing order.
Include [i, j, k] only if j is reachable from i.
Return a 2D array containing information about all reachable pairs.

#### Examples

##### Example 1

- **Input:**
```text
arr[] = [1, 2]
```
- **Output:**
```text
[[2, 1, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]
```
- **Explanation:** The links are 2 → 1 and 3 → 2. User 2 can reach user 1 in 1 link. User 3 can reach user 1 in 2 links. User 3 can reach user 2 in 1 link.

##### Example 2

- **Input:**
```text
arr[] = [1, 1]
```
- **Output:**
```text
[[2, 1, 1], [3, 1, 1]]
```
- **Explanation:** The links are 2 → 1 and 3 → 1. User 2 can reach user 1 in 1 link. User 3 can reach user 1 in 1 link.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(n^2)

```cpp
class Solution {
    public:
    void solve(int main, int i, unordered_map<int, int> &ump, int val, vector<vector<int>> &ans) {
        if(!ump[i]){
            ans.push_back({main, i, val});
            return;
        }
        solve(main, ump[i], ump, val+1, ans);
        ans.push_back({main, i, val});
    }
    vector<vector<int>> socialNetwork(vector<int>& arr) {
        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        // element, its friend
        unordered_map<int, int> ump;
        ump[1] = 0;

        for(int i=0; i<arr.size(); i++)
            ump[i+2] = arr[i];

        int n = arr.size();
        for(int i=2; i<= n+1; i++) 
        // cout<<i<<'\t'<<ump[i]<<'\n';
            solve(i, ump[i], ump, 1, ans);
        return ans;
    }
};
